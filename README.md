# Projects-404

Welcome to **Projects-404**! This repository showcases the projects I have developed since July 2024. My journey toward becoming an AI Engineer started in late June 2024 with **CS50 Python**, where I focused on self-taught learning, building skills across multiple domains like C/C++, Python, Web Development, and Mobile App Development.

## My Stack

### Technical Skills
- **Languages**: Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS.
- **Frameworks & Libraries**: React, Redux, jQuery, Bootstrap, Sass, Tailwind, Vite, Next.js, Astro (Intermediate expertise).
- **Databases**: MongoDB, SQL, React Native.
- **Tools & Platforms**: Git/GitHub, Codespace, VS Code, Web (Mid-Level).
- **Other Skills**: Data Analysis with Power BI (Mid-Level).

## C/C++ Projects
This folder contains a collection of my personal and hackathon projects developed in C and C++. These projects demonstrate my ability to work on low-level programming tasks, including algorithm implementations, data structures, and performance optimizations.

## Python Projects
In this section, you'll find various Python projects, including my solutions for **CS50 Python** and a few hobby projects. These projects highlight my skills in problem-solving, scripting, and the implementation of algorithms using Python.

## Web Development Projects
After completing CS50 Python, I shifted my focus to web development, delving into front-end and back-end technologies. Most of my web projects are built using **React.js** and include features like **GUIs**, **network interactions**, **rendering**, and **database integrations**. Some projects also incorporate modern tools such as **Tailwind CSS**, **Next.js**, and additional libraries like **React Vector Icons** to enhance the UI/UX.

## React Native Projects
This section showcases the mobile applications I have built using **React Native** with **Expo**. These apps include navigation and other essential mobile functionalities, reflecting my ability to develop cross-platform mobile applications.
